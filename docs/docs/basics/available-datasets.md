# Available Datasets

wombat draws data in a number of key areas. Many of the datasets do not require processing beyond downloading from the various silos. Some however, e.g. elevation and property sale history data, do require substantial processing from their original sources. The goal here is to house all the relevant data in one convenient directory that wombat interfaces with which can be updated periodically depending on availability. 

The major categories in development include:

- [ ] Boundary
- [ ] Socioeconomic (SEIFA)
- [ ] Flooding
- [ ] Transport 
- [x] Schools
- [x] Elevation
- [ ] Sustainability
- [ ] Census
- [ ] Noise
- [ ] Property sale history
- [ ] Heritage

These will be checked off in the coming months.
